# SSHA1
  This program finds a pair of integers (x,x’) such that x ≠ x’
  but the SSHA-1 hash values of the following two messages are the same.
    m and m’, m ≠ m’, such that H(m) = H(m’)
 SSHA1 is a simplified version of SHA-1 which only outputs the first 16 bits of SHA-1 when hashing a message.
